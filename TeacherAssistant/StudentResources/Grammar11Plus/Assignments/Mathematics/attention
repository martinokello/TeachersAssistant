Dear Jane Grogan,

I saw you at the Redan Pub some time ago. I believe you were supposed to be verified, as a person with no risk to GCHQ. You remind me of Margaret Thatcher: strong features, and aquline nose. I made an effort not to contact you, pretending I didn't know you.

Regards
AKa the Medallion.
